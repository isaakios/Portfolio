                <h1>Computer Science Student</h1>
                <p>I am a dedicated and hardworking computer science student who is always eager to learn and grow. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a passion for technology, specifically in software development, machine learning, and embedded systems. I am committed to giving my best effort in everything I pursue, consistently striving to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas.

                    My interest in technology started early, growing up as part of a STEM school team where I served as the team leader. This role allowed me to work on various hands-on projects, including Arduino and C programming, which sparked my curiosity about how software interacts with hardware. Leading the team taught me the importance of collaboration and problem-solving, two skills that I carry with me in all aspects of my academic and professional life.
                    
                    As I progressed in my studies, I also gained experience in Python, particularly using it for machine learning projects involving robotics. This blend of hardware and software expertise has fueled my interest in building intelligent systems that can solve real-world problems. I thrive in environments where I can apply my technical abilities while continuously learning and adapting to new challenges.</p>
